# The Basics

</br>
</br>

* **Data Visualization** 
    - *the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities in order to amplify cognition*  <font size = "3" color = "gray">(Andy Kirk in Data Visualization: A successful Design Process) </font>
    
    - *refers to the mapping between numerical data and graphic elements (e.g. lines or points in a chart)* <font size = "3" color = "gray">(Wikipedia)</font>
  
</br>

* **Between Art & Science**: both design and statistical skills are required to visualize effectively

# The Basics

.pull-left[
Tables are generally used where users will look up a specific measurement

]
.pull-right[
Charts are used to show patterns or relationship in the data for one or more variables

<img src="pictures/plot1.png" style = "width: 100%" />

]

# Visual  Perception & Data Visualizaion

**Pre-attentive** attributes: differences in line length, shape, orientation, distance, and color can be distinguished readily without processing efforts.
.pull-left[Attentive: count the 9s

.pull-right[Pre-attentive: count the 9s

# Visual  Perception & Data Visualizaion
Effective data visualization exploits pre-attentive processing and attributes

# Data Visualization vs Infographics
**Data visualization** is usually often **aesthetically barren** and **data-rich**

**Infographics** is **aesthetically rich** (to draw attention) and relatively **data-poor** (custom treatment of the information)

#Eploration vs Explanation
The two serve different purposes, some tools and approaches are appropriate for one and not for the other.
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Exploratory data visualization]
.pull-left[

* Typically part of the *data analysis* phase.

* Used to get a sense of data points relationship before embarking on any complex modelling exercise.

* Also useful to identify anomalous outliers.

* Generally best done at a high level of granularity.

.pull-right[<img src="pictures/exploratory.png" style = "width: 100%" />]


]

.panel[.panel-name[Explanatory data visualization]
.pull-left[

* Typically part of the *presentation* phase.

* Used to convey a *story*.

* It is a process of selecting focused evidence in support of the story you are trying to tell.

* Need to filter out distracting and irrelevant information.
